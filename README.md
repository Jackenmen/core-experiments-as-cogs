# Core Red experiments implemented as cogs

This repository aims to allow for more freedom and will consist of cogs introducing
experimental features that we cannot ship yet as part of the core project due to
potential stability concerns. This is aimed at rare scenarios so don't expect too much
to happen here.

All names of the cogs in this repository use the "core_exp_" prefix. This abbreviates to "core experiment".

## Current experiments

- **core_exp_audio_ll_updates** - Enable Audio's managed Lavalink server to be updated independently of Red's release schedule.
